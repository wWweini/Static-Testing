# Static Testing

In a group of two we developed a full-fledged GUI program on a bean counter system using static testing techniques such as: linting, pattern-based bug finding,and model checking. </br>
The bean counter is a device for statistics experiments devised by English
scientist Sir Francis Galton. It consists of an upright board with evenly
spaced pegs in a triangular form.  Beans are dropped from an opening at the top
of the board. Every time a bean hits a peg, it has a 50% chance of falling to
the left or to the right.  In this way, each bean takes a random path and
eventually falls into one of the slots at the bottom of the board.  After all
the beans fall through, the number of beans in each slot is counted.

## How to Use
1. Have all files opened in VS code
2. java BeanCounterGUI <number of beans> <luck | skill>
   Example: java BeanCounterGUI 500 luck
